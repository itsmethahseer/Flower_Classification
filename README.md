# Flower_Classification
Flower Classification using Tensorflow And OpenCv
I used python libraries for this project to draw some visulizations of the images
 installed the Computer vision package for this project
 used Tensorflow for this project and used PIL package for analyzing image.
 downloaded the data from google website and I converted into Opencv object for further processes.
Dataset Source: https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz
 

â€ƒ	I imported the pathlib library for converting the path of my images into windowpath.
	The dataset is contains the different types of flower images including roses,daisy,dandelion etc.
	Then I used preprocessing techniques in this project like train test split ,Feature Scaling etc.
	 used Convolutional neural network for this image classification, which is better neural network in deep learning.
	But my model give only 65% performance in testing data, that means it shows some overfitting conditions. To overcome this problem I used a special techniques like Data Augmentation
	Data augmentation technique includes transforming our input image into different  forms like RandomZoom,RandomFlip,RandomContrast etc..
	By converting my input images into different transforms I get more accuracy more than before using the same model
